# Research for interesting APIs online and pick two. You can also use APIs that
# you've already worked with in the course if you prefer.
# Write a program that makes calls to both APIs and find a way to combine the
# data that you receive from both of them.
# E.g.: You could use the Ghibli API to find all ghosts from their films, and
#       create an opposing team of Ghost Pok√©mon from the Poke API.
